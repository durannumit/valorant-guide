/**
 * Creating custom color palettes is part of creating a custom app. The idea is to create
 * your class of custom colors, in this case `CompanyColors` and then create a `ThemeData`
 * object with those colors you just defined.
 *
 * Resource:
 * A good resource would be this website: http://mcg.mbitson.com/
 * You simply need to put in the colour you wish to use, and it will generate all shades
 * for you. Your primary colour will be the `500` value.
 *
 * Colour Creation:
 * In order to create the custom colours you need to create a `Map<int, Color>` object
 * which will have all the shade values. `const Color(0xFF...)` will be how you create
 * the colours. The six character hex code is what follows. If you wanted the colour
 * #114488 or #D39090 as primary colours in your theme, then you would have
 * `const Color(0x114488)` and `const Color(0xD39090)`, respectively.
 *
 * Usage:
 * In order to use this newly created theme or even the colours in it, you would just
 * `import` this file in your project, anywhere you needed it.
 * `import 'path/to/theme.dart';`
