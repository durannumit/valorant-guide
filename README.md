Valorant Guide app is a small demo application to demonstrate Flutter application tech-stacks with a MobX and Provider. I don't have design file so just tried to do what I see. It's still under development and open for PR.
</p>

### Libraries & Tools Used

* [Dio](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio)
* [Database](https://github.com/tekartik/sembast.dart)
* [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx.dart) (to connect the reactive data of your application with the UI)
* [Provider](https://github.com/rrousselGit/provider) (State Management)
* [Encryption](https://github.com/xxtea/xxtea-dart)
* [Json Serialization](https://github.com/dart-lang/json_serializable)
* [Dependency Injection](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/get_it)
* [cached_network_image](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image)

### Architecture
I used  [MobX and Provider Boilerplate Library](https://github.com/zubairehman/flutter-boilerplate-project). The Boilerplate contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using boiler plate code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.

### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- constants/
|- data/
|- stores/
|- ui/
|- utils/
|- widgets/
|- main.dart
|- routes.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- constants - All the application level constants are defined in this directory with-in their respective files. This directory contains the constants for `theme`, `dimentions`, `api endpoints`, `preferences` and `strings`.
2- data - Contains the data layer of your project, includes directories for local, network and shared pref/cache.
3- stores - Contains store(s) for state-management of your application, to connect the reactive data of your application with the UI. 
4- ui — Contains all the ui of your project, contains sub directory for each screen.
5- util — Contains the utilities/common functions of your application.
6- widgets — Contains the common widgets for your applications. For example, Button, TextField etc.
7- routes.dart — This file contains all the routes for your application.
8- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.
```

### Constants

This directory contains all the application level constants. A separate file is created for each type as shown in example below:

```
constants/
|- app_theme.dart
|- dimens.dart
|- endpoints.dart
|- preferences.dart
|- strings.dart
```

### Open API
Valorant Agents uses the [Valorant-api](https://dash.valorant-api.com/) for required data.
Valorant-api provides an extensive API containing data of most in-game items, assets and more!

### Tasks
- [ ] Make HomePage items background color dynamic

- [ ] Get more data from API and add more pages

- [ ] Localization

- [ ] Widget Testing
